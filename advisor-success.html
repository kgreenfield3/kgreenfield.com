    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>SmartAsset is the leading marketplace that connects consumers and financial advisors through our <a href="https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/aboutSmartAdvisor">SmartAdvisor</a> platform. Our extensive network consists of thousands of individual and enterprise advisors from across the country. These advisors are matched with high-intent consumers.</p>
  <p>However, we encountered a considerable challenge of advisor churn, prompting us to prioritize churn reduction efforts. As part of this initiative, I was assigned the responsibility of investigating the primary drivers of success on our platform. This initial phase aimed to identify key factors that contribute to advisor retention and satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p>To delve into the factors contributing to advisor success on the SmartAdvisor platform, we conducted thorough investigations using surveys and interviews. Example questions and learnings can be found in the Appendix.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 24px;">‚ú® What are the shared characteristics among the successful advisors?‚ú®</h3>
      <p>After analyzing the insights from the surveys and interviews, we were able to identify 3 shared characteristics among the most successful on SmartAdvisor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Numbers > Emotion:</b> Our top-performing advisors possess a strong affinity for numbers and are dedicated to meticulously tracking their performance and return on investment (ROI). They exhibit resilience by not allowing isolated negative interactions with prospects to discourage them.</li>
        <li><b>Spend Money to Make Money:</b> Our advisors who achieve greater success typically allocate higher budgets, often exceeding $2,000. Having a higher budget grants these advisors more opportunities to thrive on the platform, enhancing their chances of success.</li>
        <li><b>Smart Nurturing Tactics:</b> Through our investigation, we identified two distinct tactics employed by successful advisors to nurture and convert leads. These tactics differ in terms of timing and persistence. By tailoring their approach accordingly, advisors can effectively navigate the consumer journey and increase their chances of success on the SmartAdvisor platform:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The Hare üêá: This approach involves immediate and multi-channel contact with the consumer. Advisors using this tactic engage with the consumer persistently for a couple of weeks and then move on.</li>
          <li>The Tortoise üê¢: Advisors adopting this approach also make prompt contact but are mindful that SmartAdvisor prospects receive numerous calls from other matches. They strategically wait until the initial rush subsides (typically a day or two) to stand out from the competition. These advisors maintain ongoing communication with the consumer over an extended period.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The findings from this research were highly enlightening for stakeholders throughout the organization and served as a successful catalyst for our churn reduction efforts. These valuable insights played a crucial role in shaping the product roadmap for the SmartAdvisor platform, particularly in terms of <b>enhancing ROI visibility</b> within the advisor portal and <b>addressing issues related to negative lead experiences</b>. As a direct result of this research, we established the Advisor Success team, whose primary focus is to minimize poor experiences with leads and further optimize the platform's performance.</p>

      <h3><center>Learnings</center></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Perception and reality may not always align, but both have a significant impact. Moving forward, a key challenge for the organization is to find effective ways to communicate success, even in the presence of negative experiences with leads. It is crucial to bridge the gap between perception and reality by highlighting achievements and positive outcomes, ensuring that the true value of our services is accurately conveyed to our advisors.</li>
        <li>Maintain flexibility during interviews as valuable insights that can change the entire perspective may emerge as side notes or afterthoughts. While it is important to have an outline of questions, be open to exploring different avenues and allowing the conversation to naturally unfold. By being adaptable and receptive to unexpected insights, you can uncover valuable information that may have a significant impact on the overall understanding and outcomes of the interview.</li>
