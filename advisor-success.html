    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>SmartAsset is the leading marketplace that connects consumers and financial advisors through our <a href="https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/aboutSmartAdvisor">SmartAdvisor</a> platform. Our extensive network consists of thousands of individual and enterprise advisors from across the country. These advisors are matched with high-intent consumers.</p>
  <p>However, we encountered a considerable challenge of advisor churn, prompting us to prioritize churn reduction efforts. As part of this initiative, I was assigned the responsibility of investigating the primary drivers of success on our platform. This initial phase aimed to identify key factors that contribute to advisor retention and satisfaction.</p>

      <div class = "project_overview">
        <h2>Research Process</h2>
      <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing advisor success on the SmartAdvisor platform, I conducted comprehensive surveys and interviews with individuals identified as "high-performing" by our Account Management team. These advisors were selected based on their satisfaction ratings and those with consistent monthly budgets. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TYGKOFA4lMrgFQHnB7gZdmRzBFGFWzIXVSCbPjPYpBo/edit#heading=h.otyu5snlrxjt" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù>The full research plan including the recruitment email template, survey questions, and the interview script can be found here.</a></p>

        <h3><center>Research Questions</center></h3>
        <ol>
          <li>How do advisors define "success"?</li>
          <li>What are the shared characteristics among our high-performing advisors?</li>

      </div>
<div class="section">
  <div class="research-item">
      <h4>Surveys</h4>
      <p>A 10-question survey was sent out to our high-performing advisor cohort to gather feedback on their success on the SmartAdvisor platform.</p>
      <ul><li>Objectives: Define success characteristics and approach</li>
          <li>Participants: High-performing advisors (n = 326)</li>
          <li>Deliverables: Insight report on advisor success</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  <div class="research-item">
      <h4>Interviews</h4>
<p>Interviews were scheduled shortly after the survey closed to further explore the experiences of the high-performing advisors and the key factors that contributed to their success on the platform. </p>
      <ul><li>Objectives: Deeper dive into advisor success</li>
          <li>Participants: High-performing advisors (n = 8)</li>
          <li>Deliverables: Shareable interview summaries</li></ul>
  </div>
</div><br>
<p>After collecting and cleaning the data, I calculated summary measures for quantitative questions (e.g., success rating Q) and coded textual feedback to identify recurring themes. Findings were cross-referenced with internal data to better understand advisor success on SmartAdvisor and to fill any knowledge gaps. Using these insights, I created a persona and generated research reports for a comprehensive overview of the results.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 24px;">How do advisors define "success"?</h3>
    <div class="section">
    <div class="research-item">
      <p>Based on feedback from advisors, success on the SmartAdvisor platform was commonly defined as achieving a positive return-on-investment (ROI).</p>
      <p>Our internal data confirms that advisors are most likely to achieve a positive return-on-investment (ROI) when they actively utilize the SmartAdvisor platform for a duration of 6 to 9 months. However, it is worth noting that a considerable number of advisors churn before reaching this time period. Furthermore, maintaining a consistent monthly budget of at least $2,000 has been identified as a contributing factor for maximizing their chances of success.</p>
      </div>

            <h4><center>Visual Representation of ROI vs. Time </center></h4>

    </div>
    </div>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px;">What are the shared characteristics among our high-performing advisors?</h3>
      <p>After analyzing the insights from the surveys and interviews, I was able to identify 3 shared characteristics among our high-performing advisors on SmartAdvisor:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Numbers > Emotion:</b> Our top-performing advisors possess a strong affinity for numbers and are dedicated to meticulously tracking their performance and ROI. They exhibit resilience by not allowing isolated negative interactions with prospects to discourage them.</li>
        <li><b>Spend Money to Make Money:</b> Our advisors who achieve greater success consistently allocate higher budgets, often exceeding $2,000. Having a higher budget grants these advisors more opportunities to thrive on the platform, enhancing their chances of success.</li>
        <li><b>Smart Nurturing Tactics:</b> Our high-performing advisors utilize automated lead nurturing tactics that help convert prospects. The research identified two distinct tactics employed by these advisors, which differ in terms of timing and persistence. By tailoring their approach accordingly, advisors can effectively navigate the consumer journey and increase their chances of success on the SmartAdvisor platform:</li>
        <div class="section" style="margin: 16px 0 0 0">
          <div class="research-item">
              <h4>The Hare üêá</h4>
              <p>This approach involves immediate and multi-channel contact with the consumer. Advisors using this tactic engage with the consumer persistently for a couple of weeks and then move on.</p>
              </div>
          <div class="research-item">
              <h4>The Tortoise üê¢</h4>
              <p>Advisors strategically wait until the initial rush subsides (typically a day or two) to stand out from the competition. These advisors maintain ongoing communication with the consumer over an extended period.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </ol>
</div>
</div>

  <div class = "project_overview">
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <p> To develop the "high-performing advisor" persona, I combined the recurring characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes identified through research with relevant internal data points such as time spent on the platform and budget allocation. These factors played a crucial role in shaping the persona and capturing the essence of a successful advisor on our platform.</p>

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>The findings from this research were highly enlightening for stakeholders throughout the organization and served as a successful catalyst for our churn reduction efforts. These valuable insights played a crucial role in shaping the product roadmap for the SmartAdvisor platform, particularly in terms of <b>enhancing ROI visibility</b> within the advisor portal and <b>addressing issues related to negative lead experiences</b> that drive early churn. As a direct result of this research, we established the Advisor Success team, whose primary focus is handling lead validation requests and account issues, speeding up the communication process and reducing friction.</p>

    <div class = "cs-section">
      <div class = "project_overview">
        <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Perception and reality may not always align</b>, but both have a significant impact. Moving forward, a key challenge for the organization is to find effective ways to communicate success, even in the presence of negative experiences with leads. It is crucial to bridge the gap between perception and reality by highlighting achievements and positive outcomes, ensuring that the true value of our services is accurately conveyed to our advisors.</li>
        <li><b>Maintain flexibility during interviews</b> as valuable insights that can change the entire perspective may emerge as side notes or afterthoughts. While it is important to have an outline of questions, be open to exploring different avenues and allowing the conversation to naturally unfold. By being adaptable and receptive to unexpected insights, you can uncover valuable information that may have a significant impact on the overall understanding and outcomes of the interview.</li>
