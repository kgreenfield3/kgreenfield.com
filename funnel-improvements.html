    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>SmartAsset is the leading marketplace that connects consumers with financial advisors. Before 2021, our 25-30 panel funnel attracted over 30,000 consumers each month, resulting in matching with up to 3 advisors and an average conversion rate (CVR) of 2.9%. However, the substantial drop-off rate within the funnel indicated a clear opportunity for enhancement. Consequently, the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) team was tasked with improving the CVR of the funnel experience.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 16px">Goal: Improve CVR by 100% through ongoing A/B testing of SmartAsset’s Matching Service funnel</p>

        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p>I was responsible for all research conducted for this project. I utilized a two-pronged approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of our user base and evaluate the usability of the current funnel experience. By combining these research methods, I was able to gather valuable insights that would guide our efforts in optimizing the user experience and enhancing the funnel's performance. Example questions and learnings can be found in the Appendix.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <h3 style="margin: 24px 0 16px">Who are the key user groups that utilize this service?</h3>
      <p>
During the research phase, I identified two distinct user segments: the "Pre-Retiree" and the "Getting My Bearings" groups. While both segments were in search of financial guidance and support, their motivations varied significantly. Notably, only the "Pre-Retiree" segment met the qualifications to work with a financial advisor, which left the "Getting My Bearings" segment with limited options. This discovery indicated a potential product opportunity that we could explore further.</p>

      <h4>Primary: The Pre-Retiree </h4>

    <h4>Secondary: Getting My Bearings</h4>

</div>
<h3 style="margin: 56px 0 24px;">What are the primary usability issues that prevent users from converting?</h3>
<div class="section">
<div class="research-item">
  <p> A number of UX and UI issues were identified during the usability testing phase. The primary issues can be found below:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Call-to-action (CTA) placements lacked consistency</b> throughout the funnel and would vary based on question length and answer options. Some CTAs were even positioned below the fold on mobile devices.</li>
    <li><b>The answer option treatment gave the illusion of a smaller clickable area</b>, resulting in slower user progress.</li>
    <li><b>The appropriate keyboards did not trigger</b> on text panels, leading to extra clicks for action completion.</li>
    <li><b>The end-of-funnel loading screen lasted over 12 seconds</b> and lacked timing indication or next step guidance.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>A/B Testing Concepts</h2>
    <p>The previously stated insights influenced a number of successful A/B tests in Optimizely including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CTA Positioning:</b> Standardized the CTA position on all devices, preventing any from going below the fold (+3% in CVR)</li>
      <li><b>Button Design Treatment:</b> All relevant buttons were given a border and enlarged to enhance the clickable area (+2.8% in CVR)</li>
      <li><b>Default Keyboard:</b> All text fields defaulted to the appropriate keyboard (+1% in CVR)</li>
      <li><b>Loading Screen:</b> The duration of the loading screen was reduced by 50% to 6 seconds (+7% in CVR)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class = "cs-section">
    <div class = "project_overview">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>Success! The CRO initiative saw a cumulative 95% increase in conversion in 2021, resulting in a new baseline CVR of 5.5%.</p>
      <p>  In addition, the insights gathered during this project have already informed the direction of the product roadmap for 2022 and beyond, with a number of “overhauls” to the current funnel experience scheduled for upcoming sprints including the implementation of branching, new question types (select all, ranking, “other” optionality, etc.), evaluating the matching algorithm to achieve “best fit matches”, and the development of the "getting my bearings" experience.</p>

        <h2>2023 Update</h2>
        <p>The optimization of the funnel has consistently been a top priority, guided by research insights that have shaped our testing concepts since 2021. Our most recent findings have highlighted three key areas for improvement:
        <ol>
          <li> Managing user expectations during the matching experience</li>
          <li> Effectively promoting our services to new users</li>
          <li> Enhancing UI accessibility, specifically on mobile devices </li>
        </ol><br>
        As the UX lead, I had the responsibility of overseeing the development and implementation of all UX-based A/B testing concepts within the SmartAsset funnel. In Q1 2023, we achieved a 33% success rate, resulting in a combined <b>4.68% increase in CVR</b>, which equates to an estimated <b>monthly revenue uplift of $585k</b>. These impressive results demonstrate the positive impact of our UX initiatives on the overall performance of the funnel. Example test concepts can be found below:
