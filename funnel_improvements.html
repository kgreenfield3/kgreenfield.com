      Ongoing improvements to SmartAsset’s matching service funnel to improve conversion rate (CVR).

  <h4><span class="highlight">BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  SmartAsset operates the largest marketplace connecting consumers to financial advisors. Prior to 2021, over 30,000 of consumers completed our 25 - 30 panel funnel each month matching with up to 3 advisors - resulting in an average 2.9% CVR. The level of dropoff seen within the funnel was a signal to us that there was significant opportunity for improvement. As a result, the Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) team was tasked to increase the CVR of SmartAsset’s funnel by 100% in 2021.
  <br><br>
  <h4><span class="highlight">GOALS</span></h4>
  Improve CVR by 100% through ongoing A/B testing (using Optimizely) of SmartAsset’s matching service funnel.
  <br><br>
  <h4><span class="highlight">RESEARCH APPROACH</span></h4>
  We implemented a two-pronged research approach to better understand our user base (exploratory) as well as to identify usability problems and strengths of the current funnel (usability inspection). This was done using a variety of methods such as consumer surveys, data analytics, an UX expert review as well as leveraging relevant industry research.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Research</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Methods: Consumer surveys, data analytics, industry research pull</li>
        <li>Objectives: Better understand our user base; identify opportunity areas for testing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Usability Inspection</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Methods: UX expert review</li>
        <li>Objectives: Identify usability problems and strengths of current funnel</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4><span class="highlight">KEY TAKEAWAYS</span></h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Research</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Our Audience: Our “core” funnel audience was found to be knowledgeable and generally experienced investors, driven to seek out guidance to ensure continued financial security. They’ve managed their money typically on their own with success, but have gotten to a point where they need additional expertise to maintain that momentum for years to come. These users are relatively new in their search and are eager to start working with an expert to gain clarity around their financial plan. The biggest blocker for this user segment is finding the best advisor for their needs as well as trusting that expert with their hard earned money.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Usability Inspection</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The placements of the call-to-actions (CTAs) were not consistent across the funnel experience and would move depending on the length of the question and the number answer options. A number of CTAs were even pushed below the fold on mobile.</li>
        <li>The text field panels (name, email, number, and zip code) did not default to the appropriate keyboards on mobile resulting in extra clicks to complete an action.</li>
        <li>The original design treatment of the CTAs and answer options gave the illusion of a much smaller clickable area slowing users down during the process.</li>
        <li>The loading screen, which occurs at the end of the funnel, was over 12 seconds long and gave no indication of timing or next steps.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4><span class="highlight">A/B TESTS</span></h4>
  The previously stated insights influenced a number of successful A/B tests* in Optimizely including, but not limited to, the following:
  <ul>
    <li><b>CTA Positioning:</b> Standardized the CTA position on all devices, preventing any from going below the fold (3% improvement)</li>
    <li><b>Button Design Treatment:</b> All buttons were given a border and enlarged to enhance the perceived clickable area (2.8% improvement)</li>
    <li><b>Default Keyboard:</b>All text fields defaulted to the appropriate keyboard (e.g., phone number panel defaulted to the numeric keyboard) (1% improvement)</li>
    <li><b>Loading Screen Improvements:</b> The duration of the loading screen was reduced by 50% to 6 seconds and new visual assets were added to highlight the value prop of the service (7% improvement)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <i>* Note:</i> In addition to providing all the research for this initiative, I was also the primary developer for all front-end A/B tests. This support reduced our reliance on the Tech team and allowed for higher velocity testing throughout the year.
<br><br>
  <h4><span class="highlight">RESULTS</span></h4>
  Success! The CRO initiative saw a 95% increase in conversion in 2021.
  <br><br>
  In addition, the insights gathered during this project have already informed the direction of the product roadmap for 2022 and beyond, with a number of “overhauls” to the current funnel experience already slated for upcoming sprints including the implementation of branching, new question types (select all, ranking, “other” optionality, etc.), and evaluating the matching algorithm to achieve “best fit matches”.
