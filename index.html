      <p>I successfully grew and led a high-performing team of talented researchers and product designers. I personally oversaw all aspects of the recruitment, interviewing, onboarding, and talent development process, ensuring that each team member contributed their best work within our remote work environment. Through my guidance and mentorship, our team collectively achieved remarkable results, generating an impressive <span class="highlight">average monthly uplift of $1.1 million</span> across critical areas of the SmartAsset business in the first half of 2023.</p>

    <b>The UX Research Practice</b>
    <p>Since joining SmartAsset in 2017 as their first UX researcher, I took charge of all user research activities for the organization. As my team expanded, my role evolved into fostering a culture of knowledge and empathy within the company through engaging workshops, discussions, and collaborative sharing of insights. This concerted effort to instill a deep understanding of our users and their needs directly influenced our strategic decisions and product portfolio at SmartAsset. Guided by my leadership, <span class="highlight">we successfully established a formalized research process</span> across the organization, enabling us to leverage feedback loops that inform every facet of the business and gain valuable insights from our target audience. Through continuous monitoring of feedback channels (including surveys, interviews, analytics, usability testing, and competitive analysis) we consistently unearthed hidden product opportunities, ensuring our work remained aligned with the ever-evolving needs of our customers.

    <b>Research & Design Systems</b>
    <p>As the UX lead at SmartAsset, one of my primary objectives was to formalize and optimize the research and design process. I took charge of overseeing and promoting design and research standards, guidelines, and processes, ensuring a seamless and effective UX practice throughout the organization. Under my guidance, we established a comprehensive component library encompassing style guides, custom iconography, typography, colors, and fundamental UI elements. This cohesive resource enhanced our productivity and maintained consistency across all design projects. Additionally, we fine-tuned our device breakpoints and integrated an 8-point grid system into our design practice, further refining our approach. On the research front, we focused on templatizing our narrative-based deliverables that could be easily utilized (and referenced) by anyone within the organization. By standardizing the documentation of insights and findings related to our core audience and product usability, <span class="highlight">we fostered a shared understanding and facilitated collaboration</span> across teams.
