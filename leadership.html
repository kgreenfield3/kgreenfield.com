      <h2>UX Design & Research Process</h2>
      <p>As designers and researchers, our top priority is to prioritize the consumer throughout our entire process. Our ultimate goal is to consistently deliver exceptional experiences that are both delightful and impactful. To achieve this, I advocate for the following process:</p>
      <img class="new-personas" src="design-thinking.png" alt="design thinking process">
      <h3><center>Tips & Tricks</center></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Prioritize Research:</b> Research should be treated as a must-have for all key projects. Be sure to clearly define research goals and questions to be answered early on. Utilize appropriate methods and data sources based on project resources, timing, and requirements to gather valuable insights and inform the design process.</li>
        <li><b>Explore Design Options:</b> Avoid only exploring a single design concept. Create low-fidelity mockups of multiple design options (2-3) and evaluate them using stakeholder feedback and insights from testing and research. Determine the best way forward based on these evaluations.</li>
        <li><b>Seek Stakeholder Feedback:</b> Engage key stakeholders early and often throughout the process. By involving them from the beginning, it becomes easier to gain their support, get buy-in, and alignment with the design decisions.</li>
        <li><b>Align with Business Goals:</b> Articulate the business impact of your design work. Effective communication of how the proposed solution positively affects both the business and the consumer is crucial for a UX professional. Metrics such as CSAT (customer satisfaction), CVR (conversion rate), churn rate, etc., can help demonstrate the alignment with business objectives.</li>
      </ul>
By following these guidelines, we can enhance the clarity and effectiveness of our UX design process while ensuring that it aligns with both user needs and business goals.

        <h2>Leadership Toolkit </h2>
        <h3><center>Commitments</center></h3>
        <p>My leadership approach can be boiled down to 3 commitments that I make to my team:</p>
        <ol><li><b>Lead by Example:</b> I am not afraid to roll up my sleeves and work side-by-side with my team to deliver high-quality results. I lead by example, demonstrating a strong work ethic and dedication to excellence.</li>
          <li><b>Recognition and Appreciation:</b> I strongly believe in the importance of acknowledging and appreciating the valuable contributions and achievements of my team members. I make it a point to recognize their efforts and successes upward and outward. By celebrating important milestones and accomplishments, I foster a sense of motivation, engagement, and a positive team culture.</li>
          <li><b>Trust and Respect:</b> Creating an environment rooted in trust and mutual respect is paramount. By entrusting my team members with their responsibilities and demonstrating respect for their ideas, perspectives, and contributions, we establish a solid groundwork for open communication and collaboration. I have full confidence in the abilities of my team and trust that they will give their best efforts.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3><center>Areas of Focus</center></h3>
        <p>As a people leader, I find myself hyper-focused on the following areas of management:</p>
<ul><li><b>Recruiting & Onboarding:</b> To ensure a fair hiring practice, I define the skills, qualifications, and experiences required for each open role. I also develop a standardized interview process with a set of predetermined questions. This ensures consistency across candidates and minimizes the influence of personal biases. Once hired, I work directly with each member of the team to develop a 30-60-90 plan to establish expectations and ensure a successful onboarding experience.
</li>
  <li><b>Mentorship & Support:</b> Creating an inclusive environment is prioritized to make sure that each team member feels supported, empowered, and motivated to deliver their best work. Weekly one-on-ones are used to check-in, track goals, share resources, and give two-way feedback. I also lead regular research and design critiques to provide additional support and enhance professional growth.</li>
<li><b>Career Growth & Opportunities:</b> I am fully committed to supporting the professional growth and development of all team members. To achieve this, I provide regular feedback, establish clear expectations, and partner to create personalized development plans tailored to each individual's goals and aspirations. I foster a culture of continuous learning by providing access to relevant resources, training programs, and career advancement opportunities across the organization pillars.</li>
