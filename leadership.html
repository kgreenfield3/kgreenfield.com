        <h2>Commitments</h2>
        <p>My leadership approach can be boiled down to 3 commitments that I make to my team:</p>
        <ol><li><b>Lead by Example:</b> I am not afraid to roll up my sleeves and work side-by-side with my team to deliver high-quality results. I lead by example, demonstrating a strong work ethic and dedication to excellence.</li>
          <li><b>Recognition and Appreciation:</b> I strongly believe in the importance of acknowledging and appreciating the valuable contributions and achievements of my team members. I make it a point to recognize their efforts and successes upward and outward. By celebrating important milestones and accomplishments, I foster a sense of motivation, engagement, and a positive team culture.</li>
          <li><b>Trust and Respect:</b> Creating an environment rooted in trust and mutual respect is paramount. By entrusting my team members with their responsibilities and demonstrating respect for their ideas, perspectives, and contributions, we establish a solid groundwork for open communication and collaboration. I have full confidence in the abilities of my team and trust that they will give their best efforts.</li>

        <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
        <p>As a people leader, I find myself hyper-focused on the following areas of management:</p>
<ul><li><b>Recruiting & Onboarding:</b> To ensure a fair hiring practice, I define the skills, qualifications, and experiences required for each open role. I also develop a standardized interview process with a set of predetermined questions. This ensures consistency across candidates and minimizes the influence of personal biases. Once hired, I work directly with each member of the team to develop a 30-60-90 plan to establish expectations and ensure a successful onboarding experience.
</li>
  <li><b>Mentorship & Support:</b> Creating an inclusive environment is prioritized to make sure that each team member feels supported, empowered, and motivated to deliver their best work. Weekly one-on-ones are used to check-in, track goals, share resources, and give two-way feedback. I also lead regular research and design critiques to provide additional support and enhance professional growth.</li>
<li><b>Career Growth & Opportunities:</b> I am fully committed to supporting the professional growth and development of all team members. To achieve this, I provide regular feedback, establish clear expectations, and partner to create personalized development plans tailored to each individual's goals and aspirations. I foster a culture of continuous learning by providing access to relevant resources, training programs, and career advancement opportunities across the organization pillars.</li>
</ul>
