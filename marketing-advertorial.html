    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>SmartAsset, as the operator of the largest marketplace connecting consumers with financial advisors nationwide, prioritized the development and maintenance of a best-in-class consumer experience. The existing consumer journey involved three key stages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Pre-Match:</b> This stage involved advertisements and relevant marketing campaigns aimed at directing traffic to an on-site questionnaire experience. The primary source of traffic was identified as a series of marketing advertorials on social media and partner publishing sites.</li>
    <li><b>Match:</b> The central touchpoint, which featured 25 to 30 questions focusing on consumer financial goals and preferences related to financial advisors. The data collected during this stage was used to match consumers with suitable advisors.</li>
    <li><b>Post-Match:</b> After the match, consumers were presented with up to three advisor matches. The concierge team verified and confirmed each consumer's interest via phone and facilitated connections with advisors when appropriate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h5><center>Breakdown of SmartAsset's Core Consumer Experience</center></h5>

  <p>Ongoing research revealed significant opportunities for improvement in the pre-match phase, particularly in areas such as branding, setting expectations, and enhancing the overall user experience. Addressing these areas could result in a substantial increase in traffic and lead quality. To demonstrate its potential, I developed and tested an initial concept that proved successful, paving the way for this project to become a significant area of the future product roadmap.</p>

        <h2>Research & Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Research Approach</h3>
              <p>A feedback loop was established to identify any pain points and product opportunity areas throughout all touchpoints of the consumer experience. The feedback loop consisted of an initial CSAT module and a 2-phase check-in survey that would go out 10-days and 90-days after being matched with advisors. Learnings were supplemented with an expert review of the UX/UI of all consumer touchpoints and relevant site analytics. Key findings are as follows:</p>
              <div class="research-q">
              <h4><center>CSAT Module</center></h4>
              <ol>
                <li>On a scale 1 - 5, how satisfied are you with SmartAsset's matching service so far?</li>
                <li>What is the biggest driver for that rating?</li>
              </ol>

              <div class="section">
                <div class="research-item">
              <ol>
                <li><b>Inconsistent UX/UI & Branding:</b> The pre-match stage lacked a consistent brand identity and did not offer a best-in-class UX/UI experience compared to the rest of the consumer journey. Consumers frequently expressed confusion between the initial touchpoint and the subsequent one, perceiving them as two different entities.</li>
                <li><b>Improperly Set Expectations:</b> Consumers reported dissatisfaction with the lack of clear expectations regarding what would happen next. Many expected to receive a score at the end of the questionnaire. Addressing this aspect could be highly impactful in managing expectations from the beginning and ensure high lead quality across the experience.</li>
                <li><b>Poor Mobile Experience:</b> The expert review highlighted that the mobile experience was not optimized for consumers, which was a problem as site analytics showed that a significant majority of traffic were mobile users.</li>
              </ol>

    <h3>Design Approach</h3>
      <p>Based on the learnings and insights from research, I took a mobile-first approach and focused on the following areas of the design:</p>

        <div class="research-item">
      <ol>
        <li><b>UX/UI:</b> The content structure and textual hierarchy were not conducive to easy reading or quick scanning. Moreover, the initial concept did not adhere to our style guidelines, lacking an 8-point grid and the necessary spacing. Additionally, there was a lack of clarity in setting expectations for the next steps, particularly above the fold.</li>
        <li><b>Branding:</b> The original advertorial concept failed to adhere to the correct color schemes and style guidelines for images, accents, and hyperlinks. It also featured iconography that was no longer in use by the organization.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <div class="section">
          <div class="research-item">
            <p> To verify its potential impact on the business and consumer experience, I translated the design into front-end code, which was then A/B tested using Optimizely. The design concept ran against the original concept with <b>early results showing positive trends</b> associated with CVR and lead quality. These findings encouraged the team to pursue further testing and development. Consequently, I obtained approval to create additional testing concepts and later assigned the project to one of my Product Designers, Sarah.</p>
            <p>Sarah's design work ultimately resulted in an <b>impressive increase of over $225,000 in monthly revenue</b>, primarily attributed to improvements in CVR and lead quality. This achievement also led to the establishment of the advertorial Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) team, which continues to experiment with advertorial concepts using UX/UI best practices and adhering to SmartAsset's design standards.</p>

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Bring it back to basics.</b> Adhering to best practices and basic UX/UI principles can be a valuable strategy when updating designs that were not originally developed with a best-in-class consumer experience in mind. Doing so will create a foundation for further product innovation and cohesive brand identity.</li>
          <li><b>Quick learnings can help drive the product roadmap</b> and generate significant impact for the business and the consumer experience. Get your concepts in front of users and pivot when necessary.</li>
