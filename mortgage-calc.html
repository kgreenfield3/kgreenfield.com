  <span class="highlight">BACKGROUND</span><br>
  In early 2018, SmartAsset undertook a redesign of their <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/mortgage-calculator">Mortgage Calculator</a> with the aim of enhancing user engagement on the page. Despite being a highly visited page with numerous backlinks, the calculator was not effectively engaging users. This lack of engagement, despite employing a typically successful search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, indicated an underlying issue with user experience (UX). Consequently, my team was tasked with enhancing the overall UX of the calculator to increase user engagement.
  <br><br>
  <span class="highlight">GOALS</span><br>
  Improve overall UX of SmartAsset’s Mortgage Calculator in order to increase user engagement metrics and SERP results.
  <ul>
    <li><b>User Engagement:</b> Increase user engagement (clicks per user, session duration) by 25%</li>
    <li><b>SERP:</b> Improve SERP results (top 5 on Google)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">RESEARCH APPROACH</span><br>
  <b>Research Questions:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Who are the key user groups that utilize this interactive calculator?</li>
    <li>What are the primary usability issues with the current design?</li>
  </ol>
  <b>Research Approach:</b><br>
  <ol><li><u>Exploratory Research:</u> Firstly, we conducted exploratory research to delve into the characteristics, behaviors, and needs of the calculator users. This involved employing various methods, including consumer surveys, data analytics, and leveraging relevant industry research. The breakdown of this phase can be found below:</li>
    <div class="research-approach">
      <div class="research-item"><div class="research-title">Objectives</div> <ol><li>Understand our user base</li> <li>Identify areas for testing</li></ol></div>
      <div class="research-item"><div class="research-title">Methods</div> <ul><li>Consumer surveys</li> <li>Data analytics</li><ul></div>
      <div class="research-item"><div class="research-title">Deliverable</div> User personas</div>
    </div>
  <br>
  <li><u>Usability Inspection:</u> Secondly, we analyzed the existing usability of the interactive calculator. To achieve this, we conducted extensive usability testing, examining the user experience from end to end. This evaluation helped us uncover usability problems and possible areas to improve during the redesign. The breakdown of this phase can be found below:</li>

</ol>

  <br>
  <span class="highlight">KEY TAKEAWAYS</span><br>
  <b>Q1: Who are the key user groups that utilize this interactive calculator?</b><br>
  The research uncovered that the primary user of the Mortgage Calculator was actually first-time homebuyers, early in the homebuying process, NOT experienced homeowners as we expected. This insight shifted how we approached not only the redesign, but also the creation and presentation of the content. For example, these users who were early in the homebuying process had an idea of down payment, but not mortgage amount. They were also seeking more educational “advice”-type of information on savings and income needed to buy a home - content not entirely needed by someone who is already a homeowner.
  <b><center>Primary: First-Time Homebuyers </center></b>

  <br>
  <b>What are the primary usability issues with the current design?</b><br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Research</b>
      <ul>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Iterative Usability Testing</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile First: A large majority of our traffic were mobile-users, this forced us to optimize and prioritize information on mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Interactive for the Win: Users were consistently observed in testing scrolling up and down to see how inputs would change the final numbers. As a result, we decided to implement a sticky “answer option” block that would allow users to see the final mortgage payment update without having to scroll to the primary output breakdown.</li>
        <li>Less is More: Initial complaints of the calculator were focused on the overwhelming amount of information and visual noise. It was essential for us to reduce and reorganize the information presented to the users at one time. As a result, we implemented a tabbed experience that would hide the secondary visuals and supporting content, emphasizing the primary mortgage payment breakdown.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">RESULTS</span><br>
  Success! The redesigned Mortgage Calculator saw significant increases in our user engagement metrics and SERP results.
  <ul>
    <li><b>User Engagement:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicks per user increased 53.7% overall (78.7% on mobile)</li>
        <li>Average session duration increased by 26.1% overall (31.4% on mobile)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>SERP:</b> Our SERP position increased from 19th to 4th (first page of Google)</li>
  </ul>
