    <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>In early 2018, SmartAsset undertook a redesign of their <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/mortgage-calculator" target=”_blank”>Mortgage Calculator</a> with the aim of enhancing user engagement on the page. Despite being a highly visited page with numerous backlinks, the calculator was not effectively engaging users. This lack of engagement, despite employing a typically successful search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, indicated an underlying issue with the user experience (UX). Consequently, my team was tasked with enhancing the overall UX of the calculator to increase user engagement.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 16px">Goal: Improve the UX of SmartAsset’s Mortgage Calculator in order to increase user engagement metrics and SERP results</p>

    <div class = "cs-section">
      <div class = "project_overview">
        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p> I led the end-to-end research function for this calculator redesign. Aligning to the Double Diamond model, my research approach consisted of two main phases: "discover & define" and "develop & deliver. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JuIr9tWhRF8a90mGZU8d_cNagk3bNyPBttcIHbKEHgo/edit?usp=sharing" target=”_blank”>The full research plan including the survey questions and usability testing tasks for the entire process can be found here.</a></p>
        <h3>Discover & Define</h3>
          <p>The goal of the “discover & define” phase was to gain a comprehensive understanding of our user base and evaluate the usability of the current Mortgage Calculator. An informal competitive analysis was also conducted to better understand the marketplace and to gain inspiration on inputs, outputs, content, and visuals. By combining these research methods, we would be able to gather valuable insights that would guide our efforts in optimizing the user experience and enhancing the engagement and SEO ranking of the calculator.</p>
        <div class="research-q">
        <h4><center>Research Questions</center></h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Who is the primary user of the Mortgage Calculator?</li>
          <li>What are the main usability issues with the current design?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
<div class="section">
  <div class="research-item">
      <h4>User Research</h4>
      <p>A brief 5-question on-site survey and the use of data analytics enabled us to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our audience.</p>
      <ul><li>Objectives: Understand our user base</li>
          <li>Methods: Consumer surveys & data analytics</li>
          <li>Participants: Mortgage Calculator audience (n = 105 for survey, 10k+ mo. visitors for analytics)
          <li>Deliverables: User personas</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
  <div class="research-item">
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>A task-based usability testing session was completed to identify all the primary pain points associated with the current Mortgage Calculator.</p>
      <ul><li>Objectives: Identify usability issues with current design</li>
          <li>Methods: Remote usability testing</li>
          <li>Participants: Testers similar to calc audience (n = 20) </li>
          <li>Deliverables: List of UX/UI issues (+ solution inspo)</li></ul>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Develop & Deliver</h3>
  <p>The main objective of the "develop & deliver" phase was to thoroughly test and validate the design concepts generated by our Designer, ensuring a high level of confidence in our final redesign. This was done through multiple phases of remote usability testing (details same as above) and close collaboration with Product.</p>
  <p>After collecting the data, I proceeded to categorize all the qualitative feedback in order to gain a deeper understanding of the Mortgage Calculator audience. This involved identifying recurring themes and patterns related to their motivations, goals, and concerns. Furthermore, I assessed and prioritized key usability issues based on their severity and impact.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <h3>Discover & Define</h3>
      <p> The insights gathered from our exploratory user research and initial usability testing provided us with valuable information about our primary users and also highlighted the existing UX and UI issues in the current calculator design.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center; margin: 24px 0 8px">Who is the primary user of the Mortgage Calculator?</h4>
      <img class="new-personas" src="mortgage_persona.png" alt="A persona outlining the core consumer segment for the Mortgage Calculator">
      <h5 style="text-align: center; margin: -4px 0 16px">Primary: The First-Time Home buyer </h5>
      <p>The research uncovered that the primary user of the Mortgage Calculator was actually <b>first-time home buyers, early in the homebuying process, NOT experienced homeowners</b> as we expected. This insight shifted how we approached not only the redesign, but also the creation and presentation of the content.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our analysis revealed that <b>approximately 60%</b> of the calculator audience consisted of <b>mobile users</b> . This finding strongly influenced our decision to prioritize a mobile-first approach in our design efforts.</p>
      <h4 style="text-align: center; margin: 56px 0 8px">What are the main usability issues with the current design?</h4>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="research-item">
                    <ul>
            <li>The original calculator inputs were geared towards current homeowners, creating friction for the primary audience who typically did not know certain information around their future mortgage. </li>
            <li>The content in the middle of the page overshadowed the calculator inputs, which made it difficult for the users to successfully use the calculator.</li>
            <li>To play around with the output, users had to scroll up and down after each input selection to view the updated mortgage amount.</li>
            <li>The amount of information on the page was found to be overwhelming.</li>
          </ul>

      <p>* Design inspiration was pulled after identifying the key pain points with the current Mortgage Calculator design.</p>
    <br>
      <h3>Develop & Deliver</h3>
        <p>Insights from this phase helped validate the final design concept for the Mortgage Calculator redesign. Two key areas of the redesign that were extensively tested were the output visualization and the supporting data - screenshots and insights can be found below:</p>

      </div>
      </div>
      <ul><li>Swipe vs. Tab: The tabbed experience for the output visualization proved to be more intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
        <li>Expand / Collapse vs. Button: The inclusion of a button minimized the need to scroll in order to access all the supporting data.</li>

    <h2>The Mortgage Calculator Redesign</h2>
<div class="section" id="design-update">
<div class="research-item">
  <p> After a number of design iterations and testing sessions, the following updates were made:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Incorporated a sticky output</b> on mobile to better support the "playing around" user behavior.</li>
    <li><b>Restructured inputs</b> to better align with our "first-time home buyer" audience.</li>
    <li><b>Collapsed secondary inputs and information</b> to prevent user fatigue.</li>
    <li><b>Updated visuals</b> to save space and modernize the output.</li>
    <li><b>Added a methodology section</b> to provide a basic explanation of how we do our calculations.</li>

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Conducting thorough research is crucial</b>, our insights challenged our assumptions about the primary users, leading us to completely reconsider our approach to the redesign.</li>
          <li><b>Adopting a mobile-first approach is an effective way to prioritize</b> and reduce unnecessary page elements. It encourages thoughtful decision-making and streamlines the design process.</li>
