  <span class="highlight">BACKGROUND</span><br>
  SmartAsset’s <a href="https://smartasset.com/mortgage/mortgage-calculator">Mortgage Calculator</a> was redesigned in early 2018 in hopes of improving engagement on the page. The calculator was experiencing low user engagement even though it was a highly trafficked page with a significant number of backlinks. This search engine optimization (SEO) strategy is typically very successful, so the lack of engagement signaled a user experience (UX) problem. My team was assigned to improve the overall UX of the calculator in order to drive up user engagement.
  <br><br>
  <span class="highlight">GOALS</span><br>
  Improve overall UX of SmartAsset’s Mortgage Calculator in order to increase user engagement metrics and SERP results.
  <ul>
    <li><b>User Engagement:</b> Increase user engagement (clicks per user, session duration) by 25%</li>
    <li><b>SERP:</b> Improve SERP results (top 5 on Google)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">RESEARCH APPROACH</span><br>
  As part of a two-phased research approach, we focused on (1) a deep dive into our users and the competitive landscape (exploratory) and (2) usability testing on a number of prototype concepts (iterative usability testing). This was done using a variety of methods such as consumer surveys, data analytics, usability and competitive testing, as well as leveraging relevant industry research.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Research</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Methods: Consumer surveys, data analytics, competitive testing</li>
        <li>Objectives: Better understand our user base; identify opportunity areas for the redesign</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Iterative Usability Testing</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Methods: Remote usability testing via UserTesting.com</li>
        <li>Objectives: Identify and eliminate usability issues of redesign before launch</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">KEY TAKEAWAYS</span><br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Exploratory Research</b>
      <ul>
        The research uncovered that the primary user of the Mortgage Calculator was actually first-time homebuyers, early in the homebuying process, NOT experienced homeowners as we expected. This insight shifted how we approached not only the redesign, but also the creation and presentation of the content. For example, these users who were early in the homebuying process had an idea of down payment, but not mortgage amount. They were also seeking more educational “advice”-type of information on savings and income needed to buy a home - content not entirely needed by someone who is already a homeowner.
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Iterative Usability Testing</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile First: A large majority of our traffic were mobile-users, this forced us to optimize and prioritize information on mobile devices.</li>
        <li>Interactive for the Win: Users were consistently observed in testing scrolling up and down to see how inputs would change the final numbers. As a result, we decided to implement a sticky “answer option” block that would allow users to see the final mortgage payment update without having to scroll to the primary output breakdown.</li>
        <li>Less is More: Initial complaints of the calculator were focused on the overwhelming amount of information and visual noise. It was essential for us to reduce and reorganize the information presented to the users at one time. As a result, we implemented a tabbed experience that would hide the secondary visuals and supporting content, emphasizing the primary mortgage payment breakdown.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <span class="highlight">RESULTS</span><br>
  Success! The redesigned Mortgage Calculator saw significant increases in our user engagement metrics and SERP results.
  <ul>
    <li><b>User Engagement:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicks per user increased 53.7% overall (78.7% on mobile)</li>
        <li>Average session duration increased by 26.1% overall (31.4% on mobile)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>SERP:</b> Our SERP position increased from 19th to 4th (first page of Google)</li>
  </ul>
