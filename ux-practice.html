  <span class="highlight">BACKGROUND</span><br>
  Before implementing a streamlined UX practice, our design and research efforts lacked a central point of reference, with components and templates scattered across various projects that were often outdated or inaccessible. Consequently, the design and research process became burdensome and inefficient.
  <br><br>To address these challenges, we needed to establish processes and guidelines that would significantly enhance the teamâ€™s efficiency and provide valuable reference material for stakeholders.

   <br><br>
  <span class="highlight">GOALS</span><br>
  Templatize research deliverables and develop a design system to improve UX efficiency
  <br><br>
  <span class="highlight">APPROACH</span><br>
  Optimizing both the design and research functions was an iterative process regularly informed by stakeholder feedback and learnings.
  For the design function, I hired a branding designer who reviewed and updated (as needed) our colors and UI elements to ensure everything was ADA compliant. They also developed custom iconography for us to elevate our visual branding efforts. Internally, we did the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Developed a style guide that we shared across the organization</li>
    <li>Standardized our typography and breakpoints</li>
    <li>Aligned to an 8-pt grid system</li>
    <li>Built out components in Figma</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
On the research front, we focused on templatizing our narrative-based deliverables that could be easily utilized (and referenced) by anyone within the organization. This included our research plans, reports, presentation decks, personas, and other UX deliverables. We also started the process of automating our user feedback loops and prioritizing regular insight readouts with stakeholders.

  <div class="outcome-info">
In Q1 2023, we successfully implemented the initial phase of our design system, resulting in significant time savings for both our Designers and Devs throughout the development process. By establishing a unified design system, we are able to streamline our workflows, enhance collaboration, and ensure a cohesive and accessible user experience across our products and services.
<br><br>
Furthermore, we have achieved successful templatization of all research deliverables, resulting in improved efficiency within the research function. Through the standardization of documentation for insights and findings pertaining to our core audience and product usability, we have fostered a shared understanding and facilitated seamless collaboration across teams. This streamlined approach ensures that valuable research outcomes are effectively communicated, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing our overall product development process.
