  <b>Role:</b> Hiring Manager & Team Lead<br><br>
  <span class="highlight">BACKGROUND</span><br>
  As the UX Manager and Associate Director of UX at SmartAsset, my primary responsibility was to establish, oversee, and manage the UX function in alignment with the organization's growth objectives. Our goal was to effectively address the increasing design and research demands of the business by scaling the team and enhancing the velocity and reach of the UX function.

  <span class="highlight">GOALS</span><br>
  Scale the UX function at SmartAsset, improving the design and research velocity and reach
  <br><br>
  <span class="highlight">APPROACH</span><br>
  To achieve this, I undertook several key responsibilities encompassing recruiting and onboarding new team members, setting performance goals, providing guidance and mentorship, and cultivating a remote work environment that promoted both productivity and collaboration.
<ul>
  <li><b>Recruiting & Onboarding:</b> To ensure a fair hiring practice, I defined the skills, qualifications, and experiences required for each open role. I also develop a standardized interview process with a set of predetermined questions. This ensured consistency across candidates and minimized the influence of personal biases. Once hired, I would work directly with each member of the team to develop a 30-60-90 plan to establish expectations and ensure a successful onboarding experience.</li>
  <li><b>Mentorship & Support:</b> Creating an inclusive environment was prioritized to make sure that each team member felt supported, empowered, and motivated to deliver their best work. Weekly one-on-ones were used to check-in, track goals, and give two-way feedback. I also led regular research and design critiques to provide additional support and enhance professional growth.</li>
  <li><b>Career Growth & Opportunities:</b> As a people leader, I prioritized the professional growth and development of all team members. This involved providing regular feedback, establishing clear expectations, and creating personalized development plans tailored to each individual's goals and aspirations. I actively fostered a culture of continuous learning by offering access to relevant resources, training programs, and opportunities for career advancement.</li>
  </ul>
  By focusing on these components, I aimed to cultivate a high-performing UX team that thrived in delivering exceptional outcomes while supporting the professional growth and development of its members.

<span class="highlight">OUTCOME</span><br>
In 2022, I successfully scaled the UX team by 150%, improving the design and research velocity and reach within the organization. Under my guidance, the team has since achieved outstanding results, with each team member consistently delivering top-quality work in their pillar, generating an impressive cumulative monthly uplift of $1.1M across critical areas of the SmartAsset business.
